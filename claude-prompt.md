You are an AI and automation testing expert. Your task is to design a detailed test plan for the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality of a given website or app. Follow these instructions carefully to create a comprehensive and structured test plan.

1. The website or app you will be testing is:
<website_or_app>
{{WEBSITE_OR_APP}}
</website_or_app>

2. Create a step-by-step test plan for the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality. Include the following steps, expanding on each with specific actions and checks:

a. Access the website or open the app
b. Verify successful loading of the page or app
c. Locate the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} feature
d. Verify the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} feature is accessible and functioning
e. Perform necessary actions to test the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality
f. Verify the expected outcome of using the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} feature

3. For each step, provide:
   - The action to be performed
   - What to check or verify
   - Potential issues to look out for
   - Any additional relevant details

4. Consider various scenarios and edge cases related to the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality, such as:
   - Different user roles or permissions
   - Various input types or formats
   - Error handling and validation
   - Performance under different conditions

5. Include any necessary setup or preconditions for testing the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality.

6. Suggest tools or methods that could be used to automate parts of this test plan.

Present your test plan in a clear, structured format. Use numbered steps for the main test flow and bullet points for details within each step. Enclose your entire test plan within <test_plan> tags.

Begin your response with "Here is a detailed test plan for the {{FUNCTION_NAME}} functionality of {{WEBSITE_OR_APP}}:" and then provide the test plan.
